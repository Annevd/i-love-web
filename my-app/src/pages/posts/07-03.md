## Cassie Evans: Creative Developer bij GSAP

GSAP is framework asnostic

Core library: 
- Tweens: great for singular animations.

Example:
```JS
gsap.to(".box", { x : 200})
```

Timelines are good when you need to sequence different animations. With pure CSS its hard to sequence animations. This is easy to do with GSAP timelines.

Scrolltrigger is the most popular plugin.

GSAP is like an animation toolbox full of everything you need to create responsive cross browser friendly animations on the web.

> If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

### GSAP Utils

utils.random()
```
//random number between -100 and 100
gsap.utls.random(-100, 100)

//random number between 0 and 100, with steps of 5
gsap.utls.random(0, 500, 5)

gsap.utls.random(["red", "blue", "green" ])
```

utils.mapRange()
handy when you want to animate based on screenwidths.

utils.wrap()
useful when you pair it up with modifiers.

utils.pipe()

### Let the ease do the work

Rough easing is really good for glitchy animations.

You can do a lot with easing alone.

> Reduced motion is really important, AND really easy!

Control methods to control the playhead of animations: pause, skip, restart, etc.

For example with timescale.
